For starters, you can run some functionalities of `unittest` with `pytest`, but the opposite is not true. You can see some [comparisons](https://github.com/renzon/pytest-vs-unittest) about both of the functionalities the frameworks possess. Being the most versatile tool, `pytest` is the testing framework you will encounter more often when searching for documentation. "
