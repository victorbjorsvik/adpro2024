You’ll be able to choose only certain kinds of things, such as “target enchantment” or “target creature or player.”\\nYou choose the targets for a \\nspell when you cast it, and you choose targets for an activated ability when you activate it. If you can’t meet the targeting requirements, you can’t cast the spell or activate the activated ability. Once you choose targets, you can’t change your mind later.\\nWhen the spell or ability resolves, it checks the \\ntargets to make sure they’re still legal (they’re still there, and they match the requirements stated by the spell or ability). If a target isn’t legal, the spell or ability can’t affect it. If none of the targets are legal, the spell or ability is countered and does nothing at all.Casting a Spell\\nTo cast a spell, take the card you want to cast from your hand, show it to your opponent, and put it on the stack. (The stack is the game zone where spells live. It’s usually in the middle of the table.)\\nThere are a few choices that you need to make right now. If the \\nspell is an instant or sorcery and says “Choose one —,” you choose which of the options you’re using. If the spell is an instant or sorcery and it has a target, you choose what (or who) that target is. Aura spells also target the permanents they’ll enchant. If the spell has o X in \\nits cost, you choose what number X stands for. Other choices will be made later, when the spell resolves.Now check what the spell’s cost is. Tap your lands to produce \\nthe mana necessary to pay that cost, and pay it. Once you do that, the spell has been cast.\\nResponding to a Spell\\nThe spell doesn’t resolve (have its effect) right away—it has to wait on the stack. Each player, including you, now gets a chance to cast an instant or activate an activated ability in response. If a player \\ndoes, that instant or ability goes on the stack on top of what was already waiting there. When all players decline to do anything, the top spell or ability on the stack will resolve.\\nResolving a Spell\\nWhen a spell resolves, one of two things happens. If the spell is an instant or sorcery, it has its effect (in other words, you follow the instructions on the card), then you put the card into your graveyard. If the spell is a creature, artifact, enchantment, or planeswalker, you put the card on the table in front of you, near your lands. The card is now on the battlefield. Any of your cards on the battlefield is called a permanent because it sticks around permanently (well, until something happens to it). Many permanents have abilities, which is text on them that affects the game.\\nAfter a spell or ability resolves, both players get the chance to \\nplay something new. If no one does, the next thing waiting on the stack will resolve (or if the stack is empty, the current part of the turn will end and the game will proceed to the next part). If either player plays something new, it goes on top of the stack and the process repeats.\\nT urn the page to see examples of spells on the stack.Now that you can make mana, you’ll want to use it to cast spells. All cards except lands are cast as spells. You can cast sorceries, \\ncreatures, artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers only during one of your main phases when there’s nothing else on the stack. Instants can be cast at any time.\\nSection 2: The Building BlocksSpells', metadata={'source': 'EN_MTGM14_PrintedRulebook_LR.pdf', 'page': 9})"

Once you choose targets, you can’t change your mind later.\\nWhen the spell or ability resolves, it checks the \\ntargets to make sure they’re still legal (they’re still there, and they match the requirements stated by the spell or ability). If a target isn’t legal, the spell or ability can’t affect it. If none of the targets are legal, the spell or ability is countered and does nothing at all.Casting a Spell\\nTo cast a spell, take the card you want to cast from your hand, show it to your opponent, and put it on the stack. (The stack is the game zone where spells live. It’s usually in the middle of the table.)\\nThere are a few choices that you need to make right now. If the \\nspell is an instant or sorcery and says “Choose one —,” you choose which of the options you’re using. If the spell is an instant or sorcery and it has a target, you choose what (or who) that target is. Aura spells also target the permanents they’ll enchant. If the spell has o X in \\nits cost, you choose what number X stands for. Other choices will be made later, when the spell resolves.Now check what the spell’s cost is. Tap your lands to produce \\nthe mana necessary to pay that cost, and pay it. Once you do that, the spell has been cast.\\nResponding to a Spell\\nThe spell doesn’t resolve (have its effect) right away—it has to wait on the stack. Each player, including you, now gets a chance to cast an instant or activate an activated ability in response. If a player \\ndoes, that instant or ability goes on the stack on top of what was already waiting there. When all players decline to do anything, the top spell or ability on the stack will resolve.\\nResolving a Spell\\nWhen a spell resolves, one of two things happens. If the spell is an instant or sorcery, it has its effect (in other words, you follow the instructions on the card), then you put the card into your graveyard. If the spell is a creature, artifact, enchantment, or planeswalker, you put the card on the table in front of you, near your lands. The card is now on the battlefield. Any of your cards on the battlefield is called a permanent because it sticks around permanently (well, until something happens to it). Many permanents have abilities, which is text on them that affects the game.\\nAfter a spell or ability resolves, both players get the chance to \\nplay something new. If no one does, the next thing waiting on the stack will resolve (or if the stack is empty, the current part of the turn will end and the game will proceed to the next part). If either player plays something new, it goes on top of the stack and the process repeats.\\nT urn the page to see examples of spells on the stack.Now that you can make mana, you’ll want to use it to cast spells. All cards except lands are cast as spells. You can cast sorceries, \\ncreatures, artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers only during one of your main phases when there’s nothing else on the stack. Instants can be cast at any time.\\nSection 2: The Building BlocksSpells'"

       " '4\\nSection 1:  \\nThe Basics\\nOnly one thing unites the infinite planes of the Multiverse: mana, the energy that fuels all magic. The five colors of mana are imbued \\nin the land itself, and a Planeswalker with a connection to a place can call upon its mana from across the sea of Æther between worlds.\\nEach color of mana fuels a different kind of powerful magic for you to command. For example, red spells have oR in their costs, \\nand tapping (turning) a Mountain gives you oR that you can spend to cast spells. It’s up to you whether to master one color or all five.\\nWhite\\nWhite is the color of law, order, and structure. The sprawling Plains, \\npopulated by soldiers, clerics, and angels, provide white mana. You send coordinated armies of smaller creatures \\ninto battle to teach the enemy a lesson.\\nBlue\\nBlue magic relies on trickery and manipulation. Islands provide blue \\nmana, the color of the deep sea and the endless sky. You work behind the scenes, controlling your environment \\ncompletely before making a move.\\nBlack\\nBlack magic is about death, disease, and power at any cost. Black mana comes from dank Swamps, where things fester and rot. You are as selfish and twisted as the undead creatures and unspeakable \\nhorrors you command.Red\\nRed magic erupts with fire, frenzy, and \\nstorms of rock and lava. Red mana comes from Mountains and volcanoes. You \\nact quickly and recklessly, channeling your wild emotions to summon mighty dragons or crush the ground your \\nenemies walk on.Green\\nGreen magic is about growth, life, and brute force. The Forests overflow with \\ngreen mana, which represents the pulse of nature. You empower your creatures with the predatory might of nature and \\ndominate through sheer size.Five Colors of ManaThe Magic: The Gathering game is a strategy game played by two or more players, each of whom has a customized deck of Magic cards. Over the course of the game, each player will take turns playing cards such as lands (which enable you to play your other cards), creatures, sorceries, and other spells. Each player starts at 20 life. When you reduce your opponent to 0 life by attacking with creatures and playing spells, you win!\\nSection 1: The Basics',\n",
       " 'Draw two cards.\\n“The key to unlocking this puzzle is \\nwithin you. ”  \\n—Doriel, mentor of Mistral Isle\\n™ & © 2013 Wizards of the Coast 52/249 Howard LyonSorceryOOo2oU Divination\\n121599 CU18_M14Divination\\n0052_MTGM14 S-Spell\\nFlying\\noR: Shivan Dragon gets +1/+0 until \\nend of turn.\\nThe undisputed master of the mountains \\nof Shiv.\\n5/5\\n™ & © 2013 Wizards of the Coast 154/249 Donato GiancolaCreature — DragonOOOo4oRoR Shivan Dragon28101RR06_M14\\nShivan Dragon\\n0154_MTGM14 S-Spell\\n5\\nParts of a Card\\nMana Cost\\nMana is the main resource in the game. \\nIt’s produced by lands, and you spend it to cast spells. The symbols in a card’s upper right corner tell you the cost to cast that spell. If the mana cost reads o4oRoR, you pay four mana of any kinds plus two red mana (from two Mountains) to cast it.\\nExpansion Symbol\\nThis symbol tells you which Magic set the card is from. This version of Shivan Dragon is from the Magic 2014 core set. \\nThe color of the symbol tells you the card’s rarity: black for common cards, silver for uncommons, gold for rares, and red-orange for mythic rares.\\nCollector Number\\nThe collector number makes it easier to organize your cards. For example, “154/249” means that the card is the 154th of 249 cards in its set.Power and Toughness\\nEach creature card has a special box with its power  and toughness. \\nA creature’s power (the first number) is how much damage it deals in combat. Its toughness (the second number) is how much damage must be dealt to it in a single turn to destroy it. (A planeswalker card has a different special box with its loyalty here.)Type Line\\nThis tells you the card’s card type: artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, or sorcery. If the card has a subtype or supertype, that’s also listed \\nhere. For example, Shivan Dragon is a creature, and its subtype is the creature type Dragon.Card Name\\nEvery Magic card has one or more types. A card’s type tells you when you can play the card and what \\nhappens to the card after you do.\\nSorcery\\nA sorcery represents a magical incantation. You can cast a sorcery only during a main phase of one of your \\nown turns. You can’t cast it when another spell is on the stack. (You’ll learn about phases and the stack in a bit.) A sorcery has its effect—in other words, you follow the instructions on the card—then you put it into your graveyard, which is the game term for your discard pile.Text Box\\nThis is where a card’s abilities appear. You may also find flavor text printed in italics (like this) that tells you something about \\nthe Magic world. Flavor text has no effect \\non game play. Some abilities have italic reminder text to help explain what they do.\\nSection 1: The BasicsCard Types',\n",

Like a sorcery, an instant has its effect, then you put it into your graveyard.\\nEnchantment\\nAn enchantment represents a stable magical manifestation. An enchantment is a permanent. This means two things: you can cast one only at the time you could cast a sorcery, and after you cast one, you’ll put it on the table in front of you, near your lands. (Most players keep their lands closer to them, then put their other cards closer to the middle of the table.) The card is now on the battlefield. A card on the battlefield is called a permanent because it sticks around permanently (well, unless something destroys it).\\nSome enchantments are Auras. An Aura enters the battlefield attached to a permanent and affects that \\npermanent while it’s on the battlefield. If the enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard.\\nArtifact\\nAn artifact represents a magical relic. Like an enchantment, an artifact is a permanent, so it’ll stay on the battlefield affecting the game. Most artifacts are colorless, so you can cast one no matter what kinds of lands you have.\\nSome artifacts are Equipment. You can pay to attach an Equipment to a creature you control to make that \\ncreature more powerful. If an equipped creature leaves the battlefield, the Equipment doesn’t—the creature drops it and it remains on the battlefield.\\nCreature\\nCreatures fight for you. They’re permanents, but unlike any other kind of permanent, creatures can attack and block. Each creature has power  and toughness. Its power (the first number) is how much damage it deals \\nin combat. Its toughness (the second number) is how much damage must be dealt to it in a single turn to destroy it. Creatures attack and block during the combat phase.\\nUnlike other types of permanents, creatures enter the battlefield with “summoning sickness”: a creature \\ncan’t attack, or use an ability that has oT in its cost, until it has started your turn on the battlefield under your control. You can block with a creature or activate its other abilities no matter how long it’s been on the battlefield.\\nArtifact creatures are both artifacts and creatures. They’re usually colorless like other artifacts, and they \\ncan attack and block like other creatures. An artifact creature can be affected by anything that affects artifacts, as well as anything that affects creatures.\\nSection 1: The Basics']"
