    "Memorizing an API (Application Programming Interface, e.g., [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)) is a waste of resources. Good documentation starts with a code design that makes third party usage as intuitive as possible. More often than not, code complexity easily overcomes your best intentions for a great code design. Memory is finite. Leaving behind a trail of breadcrumbs for you to find your way back is almost effortless and your future self will thank you."
