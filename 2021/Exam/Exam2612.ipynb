    "During a week, BranStorm analysed the chemical components of several breakfast cereals on their most important nutritional aspects. They produced a dataset with the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* name: Name of the cereal\n",
    "* calories: calories per serving\n",
    "* protein: grams of protein per serving\n",
    "* fat: grams of fat per serving\n",
    "* sodium: miligrams of sodium per serving\n",
    "* fiber: grams of dietary fiber per serving\n",
    "* carbo: grams of complex carbohydrates per serving\n",
    "* sugars: grams of sugars per serving\n",
    "* potass: miligrams of postassium per serving\n",
    "* vitamins: vitamins and minerals - 0, 25, or 100, rounded percentage of recommended vitamins per serving\n",
    "* shelf: display shelf (1, 2, or 3, counting from the floor)\n",
    "* cups: number of cups in one serving\n",
    "* analysis_date: date when the nutrient analysis of the cereal was made\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a Data Scientist in the present working for the number 3 brand in the market, __FasT BreaK!__. The president of FasT BreaK! knows of the past efforts of BranStorm, as the study became an Urban Legend in the breakfast cereal world.\n",

    "Although you are not an expert on nutrition, you know your way around data, and you love breakfast cereals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for the tests is in the __cereals.csv__ file. With it, you are going to try and discover what happened to BranStorm's failed efforts. Your goal is to try to find what was the best cereal in 1987. With your findings, FasT BreaK! will try to learn what the best cereal can still look like today."

    "\n",
    "1. Write a class called Cereal. In the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method import the dataframe like you did before. The init() method should have two parameters, \"file_name\" and \"delimiter\". The dataframe should now be a parameter of the class (i.e. self.df = ...).\n",
    "1. (Still in the init()) The nutritionist you are consulting tells you the __Alkaline Content__ is the sum of __Sodium+Potassium__ and is a very important parameter. Make a column in the dataframe called __\"alk_con\"__ which is the sum of the two relevant kpis.\n",
    "1. From self.df, create a new class parameter called self.nutritional_df, which will be a dataframe. This dataframe should only hold the __nutritional components__ of your original dataset: calories, protein, fat, fiber, carbo, sugars, vitamins, and alkaline content.\n",
    "1. Since you are planning on doing correlations among KPIs in the future, add the following to the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.correlation_matrix = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 - The daily_analysis (15%)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a method of Cereal called daily_analysis.\n",
    "1. Convert the analysis_date column of self.df into datetime. Make a new column in the dataframe with the corresponding weekday or name of the week day. The method has no output nor additional inputs. The method should plot a matplotlib barplot or a seaborn countplot of the number of total_tests per weekday (or name of the week day, whichever you chose previously).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 - corr (15%)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a corr() method for class Cereal. Calculate the correlation matrix of the nutritional_df dataframe and store it the appropriate parameter you created in \\_\\_init\\_\\_. \n",
    "1. The corr() method should also plot the correlation plot between the __nutritional components__ of your dataset: calories, protein, fat, fiber, carbo, sugars, vitamins, and alkaline content, that you previously stored in self.nutritional_df.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2.4 - vita (10%)\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{fiber \\times protein}{sugars \\times alkaline-content}$$\n",

    "1. In which day of the week did BranStorm conduct more tests, according to your plot? This will tell how many tests you can do in a day, in the future. \n",
    "1. The perfect cereal should have a low __Alkaline Content__. However, the correlation matrix shows an interesting relation between __alkaline content__ and all the other nutritional KPIs. What happens to __alkaline content__ if we increase fiber, protein, or vitamins? To clarify to all KPIs, use a sort_values method on the correlation matrix filtered by __alk_con__. Example: cereal.correlation_matrix['alk_con'].sort_values(). What are the two other most correlated nutritional KPIs with 'alk_con'? (you can do this outside of the class). These two KPIs actually make sense, given the numerator for vita.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Add an input parameter to the vita method (keep editing your class). This input should be called \"absolute\" and should have a default boolean value of False. If boolean is set to True, vita should change the value of self.nutrition_df to its absoulute value (use numpy's np.abs to replace self.nutrition_df with  the absolute value of self.nutrition_df).\n",
    "1. To harden the process, if vita receives an entry for the absolute \"absolute\" with a __type__ other than bool, it should raise the appropriate error with a clear message to the user.\n",
    "1. Run the new declaration of Cereal with the vita method now receiving \"absolute\" as __True__.\n",
